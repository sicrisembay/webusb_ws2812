# WEBUSB WS2812
This is a hobby project that I used to explore WebUSB functionalities.

## Note
1. This is a Makefile project.  This does not use Eclipse managed build.
2. Eclipse is only used as editor and debugging.  VS code is also a good option.
3. Linux is used to compile this project.
I had some issue when using windows powershell to build (no time to investigate).
4. As of time of writing, GNU ARM Embedded toolchain version 10.3-2021.10 is used.
